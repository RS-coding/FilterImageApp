# FilterImageApp
### mini app - Filter image

I have been doing the JavaScript30 from Wes Bos and one of the challanges is to change CSS Variables using JS.  
I found so interesting the chanllange that I decided try myself and create a mini filter image app by using the same concept that he used on the challenge.  
Also I decided to go further and use an input type file , write some JS code to get the image uploaded and then change it with the filters available.  
It is quite simple app but it is a start . You can check the result here [Demo]()
